# - Basic Features -

- dockable sidebar that shows all your visible windows in a list
- dock to the left or right side of the screen
- choose monitor in a multi-monitor setup
- customizable bar width
- autostart at windows startup
- clicking a window brings it to the foreground


# - Settings -

- persistant settings
- export, share and import settings through JSON text
- reset settings to defaults


# - Shortcuts -

- create as many global shortcuts as you want and assign them to your windows
- You can have as many shortcuts as you want
- pressing the shortcuts brings that window to the foreground
- assign these shortcuts to your most used windows
- so you don't need the sidebar at all, just use your shortcuts to boost your productivity


# - Workspaces -

- Assign windows or apps to customizable workspaces that match your current workload/task
- You create those workspaces to your needs and decide which windows belong to which workspace
- Quickly change to a different workspace, either with two clicks or a shortcut
- A workspace only shows the windows assigned to your current task
- Create a workspace for development, for office work, for browsing
- After work switch to the entertainment workspace and all the work windows disappear
- This is also handy for sharing your screen to remove all other windows


# - Sorting -

- If automatic sorting is disabled you can drag & drop the list items to sort them to your needs
- Otherwise: sort your windows automatically by title, window class, exe file, creation date or by group
- Customize and finetune automatic sorting to your own needs
- Multi-Level sorting rules 


# - Grouping -

- Automatically group together windows from the same exe file or windows class
- Show a customizable separator between groups, for excellent visibility
- This keeps your windows in a nice block and lets you find your windows way easier
- Use this for apps with a lot of windows or for apps that frequently open/close new windows
- Pin the most important window of that group to the top of the group for easy access
- e.g. using Photoshop with multiple windows: group them together and pin your main window to the top of the group


# - Filtering - 

- Use regular expressions to filter windows completly
- You can have as many filters as you want
- Filter private windows
- Or filter your Email App as long as there are no new emails


# - Title manipulation -

- Use regular expressions to change the displayed title of your windows in the sidebar
- You can have as many manipulations as you wand
- Use regex to determine which title should be changed
- and then use regex to change the title
- Sorting through multi-level sorting rules is done after title manipulation
- Change "... - Chrome" to something like "[Chrome] ..."
- Or use it to quickly see the number of unread messages (if it is somewhere in the title)


# - Text colors -

- Use regular expression to apply text colors to your windows in the list
- You can have as many rules as you want
- Your most used window (like Browser, Email, Teams...) is easier to find in the list when the text is red
- Make the windows of your test-environment green, the productive system will be red
- Let the window text get yellow if there is an unread message (if the title provides that info)
- Let it get red when an error page loads

# - Window colors

- Similar to text colors
- Use regular expression to change the background color of a list item
- Or you add a colored indicator to the left or right side of the window
- Or do all three of them
- Add a red indicator on the right side in case of unread messages (if the title provides that info)
- Highlight your most used windows with different colors to quickly find them
- Have your productive environment have a red background


# - Pinning - 

- Pin your very important windows to the top of the list, like Email, Teams, Browser...
- When grouping is enabled, pin the most important window to the top of the group
- This is very handy because automatic sorting could otherwise move those windows around
- A small indicator visualizes pinned windows in the list


# - Focus groups -

- Add two or more windows to a focus group
- When focusing on any window in a focus group, all the other windows are brought to the foregroung
- Especially handy for multi-monitor setups
- E.g. click on your email app and the calendar get focused automatically on your second screen
- E.g. focus your development IDE and your debug/log/test opens on the second screen
